myshell - shell written by Jordan Voss

running the shell:
in terminal type in
'python3 myshell.py'
to run the shell. If you desire input/output file(s) and/or arguments
include these in the command line.

the commands:
type '?' or 'help' for help
'cd <directory>' - changes the current default directory to <directory>. If there is no <directory> argument print the current directory.
'clr' - clear the screen.
'dir <directory>'- list the contents of directory <directory>.
'environ' - list all the environment strings
'echo <comment>' - display <comment> on the display followed by a new line.
'help' - display the user manual.
'pause' - pause operation of the shell until the Enter key is pressed.
'quit' - exits the shell.

Environment concepts:
The term environment refers to the environment in which a user runs application software. An environment consists of a user interface
provided by an applications manager and usually a Programming interface (API) to the applications manager.

Output redirection:
the output from a command is normally intended for standard output, e.g. printed on the screen in front of you.
However, with output redirection you can change the location of where the output of the command goes.
For example, typing in myshell.py > filename.txt will create the file filename.txt if it does not already exist
and if the file exists and contains data already, then all data will be lost.
using myshell.py >> filename.txt will create a file called filename.txt if it does not already exist and append
to it if it exists already.

Background Process:
a background process is one that is run behind the scenes and cannot be seen by the user, e.g.  logging, system monitoring, scheduling.
After the creation, the Background Process (also known as a child process) will run on its own course for performing the task independent
of the control process, therefore, the control process is free of performing other designated task.
